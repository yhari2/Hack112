# Hack112 Project

NewsHack is a WebApp developed by Yasasvi Hari, Wenhao Luebs, and Amy Zhao during the Hack112 hackathon at CMU.  It filters all the news from over 60 sources by using an API called NewsAPI(https://newsapi.org/) and the Google Maps API (https://developers.google.com/maps/) with a Django framework. The final product is an interactive maps that displays pins on each country. When the user clicks on a given pin, you get the ten most recent news articles which either mention the country to which it is pinned or come from sources which originate from that country. The project is done using Python, Java, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 

Special thanks to David Kosbie and David Anderson for like, literally every thing, Rohan Varma and Arman Hezarkhani for their informative lecture on the Django framework and the associated languages, and their entire 15-112 staff for their invaluable and constant support!
